## Tell me about yourself:

### Over my career...

- I've worked on lasers that carry data over the internet.
- Released new products into manufacturing.
- Worked on cutting edge Li-ion batteries for Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton & the McLaren/Mercedes race team.
- Created virtual production environments to model manufacturing processes.
- Transitioned into software development.

None of these were easy. There were times I was told some of the things I had to do were next to impossible.

A lot of times I succeeded. Other times I didn't. At the end of the day, you never fail if you don't try. I'll keep trying.
